#The Code is developed to3) Tool for convex building polygon decomposition. support the findings of our submitted paper entitled â€œLinear building pattern recognition in topographical maps using convex polygon decomposition"
#The tools were implemented in C# on ArcGIS 10.2 software (ESRI, USA), each tool has a separate form to set the input, output and parameters for the algorithms.
# The tool for linear pattern recognition, and 4 tools are included:
1) Tool for proximity graph generation based on CDT and skeletons considering roads, including CDT, DT like proximity graph, GG, RNG, MST and NNG. 
2) Tool for parameter computation for building characteristics, including 24 parameters of building polygons.
Details for the parameters refer to "Wei Z, Guo Q, Wang L, et al. On the spatial distribution of buildings for map generalization[J]. Cartography and Geographic Information Science, 2018, 45(6): 539-555."
3) Tool for convex building polygon decomposition.
4) Tool for linear pattern recognition, including collinear and curvilinear patterns.
